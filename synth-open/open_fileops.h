//   bool remove(const char* path)
//   bool rename(const char* from, const char* to)    fails when `to` exists
// This is not atomic against power loss: between the two renames `to` is absent and the old file is <to>.bak, the new one is `from`.
// Every reader of these files calls recoverBackupOps first (OpenPatchStore) and moves <to>.bak back, so the old file is what is loaded.
// `from` is never promoted by a reader: a write that was not acknowledged may be half done. The recovery is not complete end to end:
// when it fails on slot 0 the core's slot 0 loader only sees "not loaded" and goes on to the library and Init, whose save replaces the
// file and deletes the .bak; and the library browser lists only *.patch, it does not find an orphan *.patch.bak.
// False: nothing was replaced. `to` is as it was, or absent with the old file at <to>.bak (a failed move back, power loss).
