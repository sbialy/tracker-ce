#ifdef AUDIO_NULL_IS_SILENCE
// Same result as the stock loop below for every input (bit identical), with less work:
//  - a NULL input is silence: its gain ramp ends (previous = target) as a block of zeros would end it
//  - an input with gain 0 (target and previous) adds nothing: its block is just released
//  - nothing left to add: no output block (NULL, which every consumer reads as silence)
//  - one input left, hard clip (the only type a track mixer uses by default, saturate16 of an int16 is the identity):
//      unity gain: the input block itself is forwarded, nothing is copied, mixed or clipped
//      other gain: the gain is applied in place (applyGain is applyGainAndCopy + saturate16 for one input)
//  - several inputs: the first one with a gain initialises the sum (no memset for a muted first channel, no copy of a shared block)
